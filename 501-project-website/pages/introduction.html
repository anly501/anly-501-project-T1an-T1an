        <p  style="font-size:18px;"> 
          Cryptocurrency is a fully digital currency with no government to issue it, and no banks need to manage accounts and verify transactions. 
          Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin in the world in 2009. 
          Bitcoin is the first implemented example of a cryptocurrency. And now there are thousands more on exchange with traditional currencies such as Ethereum, Tether, and Shib. The backbone underlying cryptocurrency is a system of decentralized trust-less verification based on ledgers in blocks,  digital signatures, and cryptographic hash functions. 
          As cryptocurrency becomes more prevalent in our lives, it raises many issues that need to be researched and discussed. Cryptocurrencies have some unique properties. Some of the advantages of cryptocurrencies are security, secrecy, extremely low transaction fees, and extremely fast transaction speeds. 
          Then there are some disadvantages such as the amount of computing power and social resources that are used to acquire cryptocurrencies. Since cryptocurrency is too powerful for secrecy and privacy, it provides natural protection against criminal acts. The price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile so it is almost impossible to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. 
          The attitude towards cryptocurrencies also varies greatly from country to country.<br />
          <br />
          I am going to analyze the cryptocurrency market today through data and try to give readers without a background an understanding of the emerging market of cryptocurrency. As a high-risk gamble which could pay off, combined with the volatility of today's financial markets, should the average person invest in cryptocurrencies? 
          Are cryptocurrencies still the place where 'everyone can make money as rumors say? On the academic side, decades-long research in the field of cryptography has been launched on digital currencies, mainly focusing on distributed ledgers and Byzantine protocols. 
          What makes academic crypto so special and so successful is not that it uses any cutting-edge technology, but that it incorporates ideas from many previously unrelated fields of research.<br />
          <br />
          For this project, in addition to researching the cryptocurrency market today, I hope to provide advice for readers who want to invest in the cryptocurrency market, such as a comparison of today's exchanges. 
          With the recent big events in the market (Luna on May 27th and the Merge of ETH), I want to analyze the main reasons behind them and the impact they had on the rest of the market, in the context of how the companies issuing cryptocurrencies managed them and how the exchanges responded to them. 
          After the event, I plan to use data to analyze the impact of the event from the perspective of different issuing companies, exchanges, and users.
