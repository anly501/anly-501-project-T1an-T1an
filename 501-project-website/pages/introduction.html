        <p  style="font-size:18px;"> 
          Cryptocurrency is a fully digital currency with no government to issue it, and no banks need to manage accounts and verify transactions. 
          Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin in the world in 2009. 
          Bitcoin is the first implemented example of a cryptocurrency. And now there are thousands more on exchange with traditional currencies such as Ethereum, Tether, and Shib. The backbone underlying cryptocurrency is a system of decentralized trust-less verification based on ledgers in blocks,  digital signatures, and cryptographic hash functions. 
          As cryptocurrency becomes more prevalent in our lives, it raises many issues that need to be researched and discussed. Cryptocurrencies have some unique properties. Some of the advantages of cryptocurrencies are security, secrecy, extremely low transaction fees, and extremely fast transaction speeds. 
          Then there are some disadvantages such as the amount of computing power and social resources that are used to acquire cryptocurrencies. Since cryptocurrency is too powerful for secrecy and privacy, it provides natural protection against criminal acts. The price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile so it is almost impossible to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. 
          The attitude towards cryptocurrencies also varies greatly from country to country.</p>
